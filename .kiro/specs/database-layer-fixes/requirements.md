# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical database layer inconsistencies and missing functionality in the Skully9Ts e-commerce application. The current codebase has mismatched database services (Firestore vs Realtime Database), missing service methods, and authentication inconsistencies that prevent the application from functioning properly. This fix will standardize the database layer, implement missing methods, and ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent database service layer, so that all application components can reliably store and retrieve data without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL use a single, consistent Firebase database service (either Firestore or Realtime Database)
2. WHEN any component calls database methods THEN the system SHALL use the same database service throughout the application
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle errors consistently across all methods
4. IF Firestore is chosen THEN all service methods SHALL use Firestore operations
5. IF Realtime Database is chosen THEN all service methods SHALL use Realtime Database operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all required database service methods to be implemented, so that the API endpoints can function without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the products API calls `getProductsRealtime()` THEN the system SHALL return all products from the database
2. WHEN the products API requests filtering by category, price, or search terms THEN the system SHALL return filtered results
3. WHEN the products API requests pagination THEN the system SHALL return paginated results with proper metadata
4. WHEN any API endpoint calls a database method THEN the system SHALL have that method implemented and functional
5. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want the authentication system to work consistently across all protected endpoints, so that I can access features based on my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin middleware checks user permissions THEN the system SHALL use the correct database service method
2. WHEN a user's role is verified THEN the system SHALL query the same database service used throughout the application
3. WHEN authentication fails due to database errors THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages
4. WHEN a user accesses admin-only features THEN the system SHALL properly validate their admin role
5. WHEN user data is retrieved for authentication THEN the system SHALL use consistent field names and data structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the database layer, so that I can debug issues and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and log status
3. WHEN invalid data is passed to database methods THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return appropriate errors
4. WHEN database operations succeed THEN the system SHALL return consistent response formats
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database connection properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database service methods for all data entities, so that I can perform complete CRUD operations on users, products, and orders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with products THEN the system SHALL provide methods to create, read, update, delete, and list products with filtering
2. WHEN working with users THEN the system SHALL provide methods to create, read, update, delete, and authenticate users
3. WHEN working with orders THEN the system SHALL provide methods to create, read, update, delete, and list orders by user
4. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide efficient methods for batch processing
5. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support sorting, filtering, and pagination consistently across all entities
